# caesar_cipher
Caesar cipher encrypter and decrypter. Decrypter uses letter frequencies in English language to suggest decrypted text.

## TO DO
- Write test for hacking
- Deploy
- Write READ.ME explaining the two routes, 3 operations (encrypt, decrypt, hack)
- Add to READ.ME explaining running & deploying backend
- Like decrypted text, allow user to transform hacked text as well. Hacked text should usually come back witk full spaces & punctuation, so transform would remove these.
- Do I need tests for specific functions? not just whole operations / routes (e.g. currently have tests for encrypt & decrypt)
